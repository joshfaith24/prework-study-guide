# PreWork Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I developed this project for the fact of wanting to venture off and use what I have learned throughout the prework to the test. I learned about using multiple different codes and commands, also being able to merge codes and display images. My motivation to develop this project was to really put my knowledge of new information to the test.

It has the information and commands to successfully be able to comprehend the information without copy and pasting. It also lists the subjects and topics from the prework, and can choose to study a topic first and go from there.
